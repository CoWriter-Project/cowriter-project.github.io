===================

The CoWriter Project aims at exploring how a robot can help children with the acquisition of handwriting, with an original approach: the children are the teachers who help the robot to better write! 
This paradigm, known as learning by teaching, has several powerful effects: 
it boosts the children' self-esteem (which is especially important for children with handwriting difficulties), 
it gets them to practise hand-wrtiing without even noticing, 
and engages them into a particular interaction with the robot called the Protégé effect: 
because they unconsciously feel that they are somehow responsible if the robot does not succeed in improving its writing skills, 
they commit to the interaction, and make particular efforts to figure out what is difficult for the robot, 
thus developing their metacognitive skills and reflecting on their own errors.
